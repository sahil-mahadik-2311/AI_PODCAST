# Hero image (right side of homepage)

To show your own image on the right side:

1. Save your image as **`hero-mic.png`** in this folder (`frontend/public/`).
2. Restart or refresh the app if it’s already running.

If `hero-mic.png` is missing, the app shows a placeholder. Once the file is here, it will be used automatically.
